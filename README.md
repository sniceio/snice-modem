# Snice Commons

Even Super Nice things have things in Common.

Also because it seems that you cannot have a single project without a commons/utils/stuff project so this is that one place for all of that junk you have been hording over the years but have had nowhere to put it. This is that place. The only requirement - all Snice Common things can only be dependent on the JVM, nothing else.
